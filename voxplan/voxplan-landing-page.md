## The Problem with Traditional Task Apps

You've tried them all. The to-do lists that grow endlessly. The project managers that require a PhD to operate. The habit trackers that guilt you into submission.

**They all miss the point.**

Goals aren't flat lists. They're hierarchies. "Learn guitar" breaks down into "master chords," which breaks down into "practice F chord." Real achievement requires this natural decomposition — but without overwhelming complexity.

**Time is your only real constraint.** You can have unlimited goals, but you only have 24 hours. Most apps ignore this fundamental truth. VoxPlan doesn't.

---

## How VoxPlan Works

### 1. 🎯 Organize Goals Naturally

Create a hierarchy up to 3 levels deep. Deep enough to be meaningful, shallow enough to stay sane.

```
Learn Guitar
├── Master Chord Progressions
│   ├── Practice G-C-D progression
│   └── Learn F chord fingering
└── Learn to Read Tablature
    └── Play first song from tabs
```

**Why it matters:** Your brain already thinks this way. VoxPlan just makes it visible.

### 2. ⏰ Set Daily Time Quotas

For each goal, decide: "How many minutes per day?" and "Which days?"

- 60 minutes of coding, Monday-Friday
- 30 minutes of guitar, every day
- 90 minutes of writing, weekends only

**Why it matters:** Goals without scheduled time are just wishes.

### 3. 🏅 Earn Medals with Focus Mode

Start the timer. Work deeply. Every 30 minutes earns a medal:

- 30 min = 🥉 Bronze Medal
- 60 min = 🥈 Silver Medal
- 90 min = 🥇 Gold Medal
- 4+ hours = 💎 Crystal (the ultimate daily achievement)

**Why it matters:** Gamification that rewards what actually matters — sustained focus.

### 4. 📊 Track Weekly Progress

See at a glance whether you're hitting your quotas. Gold stars for success, purple stars for overachievement.

**Why it matters:** Accountability without judgment. Data without overwhelm.

## What Makes VoxPlan Different

### 🧠 **Cognitive Architecture**
Not another flat list. VoxPlan mirrors how your brain actually organizes complex goals.

### ⏱️ **Time Banking**
Every focused minute gets "banked" against your goals. See exactly where your time goes.

### 🎮 **Meaningful Gamification**
No fake points or manipulative streaks. Just medals for actual focused work.

### 📱 **Distraction-Free Focus Mode**
When the timer runs, your phone becomes a dedicated work tool. Nothing else.

### 🎯 **Quota Reality Check**
Set a 2-hour daily quota? The app shows you need 14 hours/week. Reality, visualized.

## Built by Richard Thompson

I'm an AI engineer who got tired of productivity apps that don't actually make you productive. VoxPlan is the app I wanted to exist — so I built it.

### Why I Built VoxPlan

I had too many goals and not enough time. Sound familiar? Every app I tried either:
- Treated everything as a flat list (unrealistic)
- Required complex setup (Notion, I'm looking at you)
- Used dark patterns to create addiction (streaks that reset)
- Ignored the time component entirely

VoxPlan is different because it's built on a simple truth: **You achieve what you consistently spend focused time on.** Everything else is noise.
